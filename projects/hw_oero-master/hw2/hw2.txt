Problem 1

Part A

The status of the file is unmodified

Part B

README.md is modified and fun_problem.txt is untracked

Part C

Both README.md and fun_problem is staged and ready to be committed

Part D

Both files are modified

Part E

README and checkout are both staged

Fun problem is empty because the checkout command changes the file to the last commit

Part F

Modified


Problem 3

Part A

O(n log n)

The inner loop runs log n and outer loop runs n

Part B

O(n-1 * (n/2))

Part C

O(n^2)

Part D

Theta(n-1) + Theta(2n) + Theta(3n - 1/n)

Problem 4

1. An array of strings with 0 = the first president. The array would allow people to put 
the original number of president when searching the array and the array 
would take in (input - 1) to compensate.

Or you can use a list of strings and use get to access a president at that value.

2. Use a map
the key is zipcode
value associated with key is the population

Using a map will allow for a quick and speedy access to whatever zip code is needed

3. A set would be the best data type to use. You can add students that did they tricky problem and remove students if you ended up making a mistake. You can use a boolean to search if a student is in the set

4. A map would be the best data type to use in this situation. The key would be the assignment and ID number and 
the value would be the numerical value for that assignment for that student.

Problem 5.

Problem 5 Reverses the linked list. Function B iterates to the end of the list and sets the pointer to what was
passed at in1.
